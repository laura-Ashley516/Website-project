First Personal Website Project

  I intend for this web site to be a lil bit like canva and linkedIn but just for resumes. The purpose of this website is for it to be like a plus to my job applications. The website will gather all my professional background while allowing me to express my personality with colors etc. Since a resume mostly gathers parts of who i am, the website might let the employer better know what type of person I am. There'll be a profile pic, link section with the links to my socials and/or projects, an info section, it might also include stuffslike my fav music/show, as well as my resume etc... (but since i have multiple resumes and jobs don't all look for the same skills I'm not sure of adding the resume section). As time goes by i'll figure out more about what to do with my website.
